Dirt is a lightweight command-line tool built in Go that helps
developers maintain clean Git repositories across their workspaces. It
scans specified directories (and subdirectories up to 2 levels deep) for
Git repos, checking each for uncommitted changes or unpushed commits.

# The Problem It Solves

In large codebases or multi-project setups, it's easy to forget about
local changes or commits that haven't been pushed. Dirt automates the
discovery of "dirty" repositories, saving time and preventing lost
work or merge conflicts.

# Key Features

- Recursive scanning: Searches directories up to 2 levels deep by
  default
- Clear output: Uses colored terminal output to highlight clean vs.
  dirty repos
- Flexible targets: Specify multiple directories or scan the current one
- Fast execution: Leverages Go's performance for quick scans

# Technical Decisions

- Go ecosystem: Chosen for its speed, cross-platform binaries, and
  strong standard library
- Cobra CLI framework: Provides robust command-line parsing and help
  generation
- Lipgloss styling: Adds visual appeal with minimal dependencies for
  terminal output
- Simple architecture: Pure functions for core logic, easy to test and
  maintain

# Getting Started

```bash
go install github.com/crnvl96/dirt@latest
```

```bash
# basic usage
dirt (scans current directory) or dirt -t ~/projects -t ~/config
```
